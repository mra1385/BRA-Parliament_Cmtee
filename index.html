As a result of the application of bank restructuring tools, creditors of the same class, according to Appendix No. 1, shall not be in a worse financial position than their presumed position in the event of the bank’s liquidation. In circumstances where it becomes apparent to a creditor and/or shareholder that their financial position upon the bank’s restructuring is worse than their presumed financial position had a liquidation decision been taken instead of a restructuring decision in the context of this law, creditors and/or shareholders may submit appeals to the special court mentioned in Article 29 of this law within a maximum period of three months from the date of publication of the restructuring decision. In cases where the entitlement of the creditor and/or shareholder is proven, the special court shall determine the value of the compensation and request the bank to pay it.</li></ul><p id="240ca1c0-c75b-8118-b3c1-cd2fa98b6f00" class="">(Write-down and/or conversion of liabilities into capital instruments) In the event of using Bail-in as one of the bank restructuring tools, this tool is applied to customer deposits.</p><p id="240ca1c0-c75b-81c3-96a6-c198593e5022" class="">15</p><hr id="240ca1c0-c75b-81ca-9dc5-d394cfdacff9"/><h2 id="240ca1c0-c75b-8168-b2a7-ce4a5bcdd846" class="">Page 16</h2><ul id="240ca1c0-c75b-81b5-a699-cbba64b8172c" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">Bank restructuring tools shall be used until the bank complies with the minimum capital adequacy requirements.</li></ul><ul id="240ca1c0-c75b-81cd-b120-dfb14c00d79c" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">Certain liabilities are excluded from the write-down or conversion into capital instruments mechanism, as indicated in Appendix No. 1 (Excluded Liabilities).</li></ul><ul id="240ca1c0-c75b-8174-b954-c4299746563d" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">The bank’s obligations related to contingent liabilities, including off-balance sheet guarantees and credits, shall be canceled where possible without additional risks and costs, and the cash guarantees provided against them shall be released.</li></ul><ul id="240ca1c0-c75b-81ca-8d6e-c6bb6b7f4e46" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">Financial derivative contracts shall be terminated, and the remaining related liabilities, if any, shall be considered unsecured liabilities, if possible without additional risks and costs.</li></ul><ul id="240ca1c0-c75b-814d-b096-e07b01e54c93" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">All temporary accounts shall be settled or netted.</li></ul><ul id="240ca1c0-c75b-811d-a6d7-e66277f0faf3" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">Netting shall be performed between funded facilities (i.e., on-balance sheet facilities) and the cash guarantees and/or cash margins and/or the fair value of financial instruments (bonds, shares, etc., if any) provided as collateral against these facilities, up to the amount utilized from these facilities and subject to the existence of a legally enforceable netting agreement and the fulfillment of netting criteria in accordance with International Accounting Standard No. 32.

of access to their deposits, the fruit of their life’s work. In most cases, the banking sector has been greatly affected, and the state’s responsibility is to work towards finding appropriate solutions based on two intertwined principles: safeguarding the rights of depositors and working to restore the recovery of the banking sector so it can fulfill its credit role, finance the economy, and stimulate its growth.</p><p id="240ca1c0-c75b-81bb-8130-eff7c657ad27" class="">As Lebanon confronts the economic, financial, and banking crises it suffers from, in addition to preserving depositors’ rights, it requires taking legislative steps related to three main reforms concerning banking secrecy, the restructuring and treatment of the financial gap, which allows for the rebalancing of the financial system.</p><p id="240ca1c0-c75b-8142-8b4f-d7fdacf94a7e" class="">Accordingly, the government approved, as a first step, a draft law aimed at amending the Banking Secrecy Law, as a necessary condition for accountability and for accurately understanding the financial gap, with retroactive effect for a period of fifteen years from the date of submission of each request.</p><p id="240ca1c0-c75b-819d-9430-f7b79e217205" class="">As a prelude to establishing a draft law for financial rebalancing and deposit recovery that allows for the reform of the banking situation in Lebanon, this draft law related to reforming the banking sector comes as a second step, to establish a modern legal framework in accordance with the best international standards adopted in Lebanon and needed by the government, as well as by banks, to deal with all financial crises, especially the current severe crisis that has caused harm to Lebanese citizens and the Lebanese economy.</p><p id="240ca1c0-c75b-818a-b826-c0648c1629d3" class="">In addition to responding to this urgent need, the proposed law is still a demand from Lebanese legal experts and from international institutions interested in helping Lebanon.</p><p id="240ca1c0-c75b-8171-96d1-ce43dfd7cbe3" class="">These two steps will be followed, in the near future, by a third step, which is to establish a draft law on addressing the financial gap that allows for financial rebalancing and contributes to pulling Lebanon out of the depths of the crisis it has experienced since 2019.</p><p id="240ca1c0-c75b-818e-8771-eae17d0265e3" class="">35</p><hr id="240ca1c0-c75b-81f2-9666-c9d8a976abb3"/><h2 id="240ca1c0-c75b-813f-bb20-f110cc85fc34" class="">Page 36</h2><p id="240ca1c0-c75b-81f3-b0cc-ffa77c37ca43" class="">It should be noted that the implementation of this draft law, in the context of carrying out the three related steps mentioned above, is suspended until the enactment of the Financial Regularization and Deposit Recovery Law, as the latter is considered a necessary prerequisite for restoring balance to the financial system.</p><p id="240ca1c0-c75b-81c5-85ba-cff6b9e5e069" class="">Therefore,<br/>The government has prepared the attached draft law and, in submitting it to the honorable Parliament, requests its enactment.<br/></p><p id="240ca1c0-c75b-813a-b1af-d401764a10a4" class="">36</p><hr id="240ca1c0-c75b-8183-b522-eee043c80b67"/></div></article><span class="sans" style="font-size:14px;padding-top:2em"></span></body></html>
